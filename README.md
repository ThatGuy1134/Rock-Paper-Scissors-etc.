# Rock-Paper-Scissors-etc.
Roshambo with the ability to add your own weapons

The default plays with just rock, paper, and scissors, but you can add more/other weapons.
I'm sure that there is a better way to get a random choice from the computer, but this works pretty well.
It also creates a text file to save your score.

# Future:
Make it so that you can start over with a new weapons list.
